# TE loader

  - This is the library that is used to create and parse the loader files used to load the resources in Project-TE.
  - Currently it only supports managing Textures, Animations and other Loader files.
  - It is so becuase these are the main resources currently being used in Project-TE.
  - It will be later expanded with fonts, sfx, and music and any other resources that may arise later on as and when needed.
